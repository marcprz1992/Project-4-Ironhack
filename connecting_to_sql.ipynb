       " 'review': 'The Legend of Zelda has always been a franchise that best typifies Nintendos desire to create memorable  substantial adventures. If Mario is all about precise mechanics and pure enjoyment  Zelda is a series that focuses on storytelling  world-building and classical tropes of good against evil  Hero against returning villain. Since The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time first brought the series into three dimensions  however  it can be argued that evolution has been minimal. Nintendo has made attempts to move the franchise into new realms  but technology limitations and no doubt other concerns slowed that progress - The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword  though fantastic in its own right  didnt live up to its pre-release billing as a significant shake-up of the IP. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild delivers the revolution that has undoubtedly been desired within Nintendo and  it seems  among many fans. This is still quintessential Zelda  but the old formula has been drastically overhauled to the point that its almost been ripped up and re-written from scratch. What we have  then  is the most ambitious title in the history of the franchise; most importantly it delivers on its staggering potential. In opting for a true open world  a key question for this title was how it would marry together freeform exploration and spontaneity with a narrative structure; worry not  we wont get into plot spoilers here. The series as a whole has stuck to a template partly due to its storytelling approach  with the returning Hero tackling evil across multiple ages  a cyclical process that gives impressive scope for lore and - of course - timeline theories (though Nintendo eventually produced an official timeline). The good news is that this entry maintains a notable primary narrative  which actually kicks into gear sooner than wed anticipated. Reflecting on the core story after the credits have rolled  what we will say is that its not only well written but it is  also  a slightly more grown-up approach from Nintendo. The trademark quirks of the IP are still present throughout a playthrough  but the manner of the storytelling and the tone continues some of the progress seen in the past couple of generations. Nintendo  importantly  found a clever hook for working in stylish cinematics without them being disruptive. Some sequences will run for all players regardless of their approach  but many come through optional work; its a testament to the developers that we wanted to explore these additional segments. In addition  the concept of generational battles  not only with Link waking up but also going back to that cyclical history  is told through seemingly inconsequential moments. If you speak to the right character that happens to be a bard  for example  you can learn all about the history of Hyrule. Find the right areas in the world and Links memories are triggered. For those happy to take their time  theres depth to be discovered. Our final point on storytelling relates to the idea - espoused by Eiji Aonuma in particular - that players can in theory dash to the end right away. Technically thats correct  but to be blunt its not a realistic or desirable option. There will be a handful of extremely talented speedrunners that pull it off  but theyll be an exception to the rule. The structure of the tale is carefully crafted by Nintendo to ensure that the tools needed for the job take plenty of work to obtain. Even those seeking to simply blitz the story are looking at a substantial playtime. The reality of the experience  of course  is that this is truly an open world title. The initial Great Plateau area  so familiar from all those demo videos  serves as a solid introduction to the challenges youll face. You can wander off and experiment  of course  but even following objectives will take you to a point where you must choose your own way; its a microcosm of whats to come. Its likely an area that had a great deal of focus from Nintendo; in those opening hours youre taught - often indirectly and with some embarrassing failures on your record - about the arts of survival  exploration  combat and puzzle solving. In the initial Shrines - small puzzle-driven challenges - you gain access to Links abilities  which provide him with bombs  magnesis and stasis on tap. You learn about inventory management  and the limitations on how many swords  shields and bows Link can carry. You begin to hunt and gather  and then cook obtained ingredients to create meals - a baked apple will recover more health than a raw apple  but the experimentation goes far further. Your weapons and shields will start to break  and youll come to areas where you need to compensate for tough conditions either by wearing the correct clothes or  more likely  cook a meal with a timed resistance to the elements. Importantly  despite the inherently daunting nature of the freedom youre given and the systems you must control  the light-touch instructions do a sterling job of helping you grasp these mechanics. The depth is manageable  and when you fail you learn from your mistakes. This is a game where all players will need to get used to the Game Over screen  with Links early weakness and initial mistakes all prompting frequent deaths. Yet the auto-saves (and one manual save per user on the system) mean you rarely lose more than a minute of progress. You fail  adapt and try again. Once you swoop into the wider world Link enters another realm figuratively and literally. The Adventure Log truly comes into play at this point  which is Nintendos take on the objectives / mission structures seen in other major open world games. A parallel with a title like Skyrim is that youre given the end goal as an objective very early; as mentioned above  however  targeting it right away amounts to suicide. As you explore  interact and take actions  however  your list of Main Quest objectives expands  and a dizzying range of side- and Shrine-quests also emerge. For those willing to invest weeks and perhaps months of their gaming lives into Breath of the Wild  the incentives are there. Nintendo has created the biggest Hyrule yet  and its also the most engaging and varied. If you pick a direction and run you will eventually find enemy encampments  towns  stables (where you can board and claim ownership of the horses that you tame from the wild)  and wanderers (friendly and otherwise) that you can engage with. Youll also find sweeping vistas and mountain ranges that  much like the real world  are only populated by nature and abandoned property - if you see it  you can get there  even if tricky climbing is required. Nintendos creation of a Hyrule under a looming threat  and with brutal battles in its not-so-distant past  is extraordinary. The sheer scale of the world not only means you can discover interesting side-quests and lore in the most unexpected of places  but youll also need to manage your map - even when focused on story objectives. Adopting an approach used in so many games of the genre  Nintendo tasks you with finding and climbing towers in each region  in the process revealing that map segment. Whenever a new area is touched upon a tower should be a priority - not only is the map information invaluable  but the elevated view helps you to spot areas of interest. Theres a certain thrill in gazing over Hyrule from on-high  spotting an interesting building  assigning a pin or stamp on the map and setting forth. These tools also mean that you can mark places of interest to address later on  if youre not keen on being distracted every time Hyrule throws up an intriguing landmark. Part of the joy of Breath of the Wild is the ability to do as you please  assuming youre well prepared and equipped. Every step of the way youll be gathering food  items and valuable ores as resources  and youll be selling and buying goods to enable further exploration. Perhaps youll sell a lot of monster parts or ores to buy special clothing that allows you to traverse a harsh environment  or youll attempt to make do by cooking meals and elixirs for temporary effects. What is fundamentally true is that those that dont engage with these mechanics  dont scavenge and place survival top of the list  will have an extremely tough time. This game is all about embracing nature  local economies and allies  while preparation is a fundamental requirement in order to give Link a fighting chance. Beyond these open-ended mechanics  the conventional Legend of Zelda design can still be found  bubbling under the surface. You may upgrade areas such as health hearts differently to before  but its still a key part of progress. Youll also find an extensive cast of characters that are relevant to the story or  in some cases  are simply there to further the sense of a living  breathing world. At times  particularly after a long stretch of climbing to high points and exploring barren and cruel mountain ranges  the world can feel unwelcoming. Yet follow beaten paths and roads and there are structures  multiple towns  villages and islands to be found. Some are extremely optional  and can in theory be completely ignored. Yet such is the humour  innocence and occasional cuteness of the Hyrule inhabitants  the urge to meet as many characters as possible is hard to resist. It was actually quite late in our playthrough - primarily targeting the story due to time constraints - that some of the most memorable moments emerged; for others  these could arrive earlier in the experience. The broad range of mechanics and Links athleticism to dash  climb and glide are worked into fast-paced and unexpected sequences  or the ability to change clothes becomes important in unexpected ways. In one scenario we searched for conventional solutions before realising that boldness was needed to sprint through a treacherous area. We stockpiled health-giving meals and elementary elixirs and engaged in a mad dash to a safe spot. It was fantastically constructed  and even the reactions of the locals as we arrived at their abode was delightfully comedic  reflecting the unconventional route wed been forced to take. Its hard to disagree with what Tom has said here; Breath of the Wild is a truly seminal video game  and arguably one of the best launch titles any piece of gaming hardware has ever witnessed. While it certainly deviates from the tried-and-tested Zelda template with many of its innovations â\\x80\\x93 breakable weapons being one example which perhaps wont sit well with everyone â\\x80\\x93 it has enough of the core Zelda magic to feel like part of the lineage  and is a game which truly expands and evolves the series. Offering many hours of gameplay  an immersive world to explore and some of the most engaging gameplay yet seen from the franchise  Breath of the Wild is unquestionably one of the greatest games of all time. As Tom says  this is a title which takes an esteemed series in a bold new direction  and is an absolute triumph in every sense of the word. No Switch owner should miss out on this.  Damien McFerran Editorial Director Those small moments stand out  but this title hasnt lost its flair for the theatrical and high-stakes scenarios. There are a small number of dramatic scripted battles that add even more variety to proceedings  and beyond the 100 puzzle-like Shrines there are a small number of conventional dungeons. By the time we reached the denouement of the core story we were - in a literal sense - on the edge of our seat as we played. Were giving away as little as possible here so that further details are optional for you to find online  but we ended the game satisfied with the collection of memories wed accumulated. The character development  the atmospherics - all of it delivered. From quirky light-hearted sections to world-defining events  wed spent tens of hours becoming utterly immersed. Moving on to the foundations that hold that extraordinary world and experience together  we have what is quite likely the most complex set of control requirements yet seen in the series. Every button on the two Joy-Con or Pro Controller is put to work in some way  but by the time youre done in the opening area you should have a good grasp of how to manoeuvre Link to your satisfaction. Hes particularly agile  so youll be far more interested in his stamina than you ever were in Skyward Sword; steep climbs - looking for footholds in which to gather breath and energy - are like a mini-game in themselves. Combat is also satisfying  with the breakable weapons and the ability to quickly steal and use items dropped by enemies adding an extra level to strategy. Some enemies use long weapons that you need to dodge around  others opt for melee that encourages you to backflip away. Time a dodge well and you can execute a Flurry attack for increased damage  and the systems-based mechanics also make for fun ideas - you can push boulders onto foes  crush them by using magnetism on metal objects  or pick them off with bombs and arrows (motion controls can also be used for precise aiming). The AI is generally smart  too  with enemy encampments often having look-outs that sound the alarm if youve failed to implement the stealth mechanics properly. That said  its not ground-breaking artificial intelligence  as enemies can still be slightly dim on occasions. As an obligatory mention of amiibo  the various Zelda ranges unlock useful items - oddly you have to enable amiibo in the menu and it appears as a rune ability  which is a cute way to try and integrate it into the world. Some figures deliver some particularly neat weapons and throwbacks (scan a Smash Bros. series Link figure  we beg you). Ultimately  its unremarkable implementation thats easily ignored  though the idea of a Wolf Link as a daily companion is a nice exception to that rule. Aesthetically  Breath of the Wild is beautiful; at times its Wii U origins show and  at this stage  were yet to see what the Switch can truly do. Nevertheless  some modest textures are counteracted by terrific art design  which isnt particularly surprising. The overall image is attractive  and its also the incidental touches that catch the eye - lizards will scamper away  youll spot flocks of birds and groups of wild horses in the distance  and features like grass and water look gorgeous. The changeable weather (days are 24 minutes  for those wondering) is also a highlight  with rain impacting your ability to climb  and lightning striking Link if he has any metallic gear equipped. There are a few cracks in the worlds logic that we should point out  though theyre relatively minor. Occasionally the code will prompt a pursuing enemy to simply disappear (though this is rare)  and a few NPCs seem to forget previous visits and repeat their let me show you something moments. In general the world is a masterpiece of design and craft  but like many open-world games there are occasional slip-ups  fleeting moments when the immersion is weakened. Moving on to the merits of handheld and TV play  the game naturally shines when the Switch is docked and youre getting the 1080p output on your larger screen (though the game is native 900p  we should add). As the Switch supports full RGB range (finally) the visuals really pop and appeal on a quality TV; in this case the draw distance and graphical effects are at their best. Playing on the 6-inch 720p console screen is perfectly acceptable  though  and can certainly be pleasurable when spending some time exploring or completing side-quests. The systems screen is nice and sharp and its the best-looking portable title weve played to date (including tablets etc)  but we still suggest enjoying the big moments on a TV. It terms of performance  we have a mostly solid 30fps throughout. There are dips and chokepoints  however - occasionally theres very brief stutter thats likely related to the game streaming assets  but there are also a small number of areas that are more consistent in their drops. Alpha effects and some visual flourishes seem to blame  though in almost all cases slowdown happens at non-critical points - in key battles or tricky areas Nintendo seems to have prioritised a smooth framerate. We dont think these drops are particularly damaging to the experience but they are there  and those playing on a shiny new Switch may feel pangs of disappointment when it happens. Open-world games typically have performance issues at launch on consoles  the question will be whether Nintendo mimics a studio like CD Projekt Red in diligently patching out dips like these. Audio  meanwhile  is a real high-point in this title. To address the voice-acting question  theres not as much as youd expect based on trailers  so youre still reading plenty of text. Musically  we have orchestral performances in sweeping moments and atmospheric  subtle sounds when exploring a quiet area of the wilds or moving somewhere sacred. Its impressive sound design  designed to blend with your actions and the world rather than define them. Play with good speakers or headphones. Beyond that  when it comes to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild theres almost too much to say  and some will feel weve rambled on too long already in this review. The main point is this - its an incredible game  and may come to be considered as the best in its series. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a landmark release for its franchise and Nintendo. Its the first time that Nintendo has truly taken on the open-world genre in a current-generation sense; in arriving late to the party  though  it embraces some strengths from top-of-the-class games while also forging its own identity. This game is a revolution for the franchise  but the Legend of Zelda essence is still there - its soul remains. The end result  then  is a captivating experience. This will be in the running as the best game in the IPs history  and it will likely be discussed as a leading contender in the broader open-world genre. Nintendo has bravely taken one of its biggest franchises in a new direction  and its delivered a triumph.

       " 'review': 'Long before Fortnites metaverse and brands talking to each other on Twitter  there were the Lego games: winning combinations of a world-favourite kids toy and some of the biggest movie franchises in the world. Star Wars  Harry Potter  Indiana Jones  and Batman were all Lego-ified by UK-based Travellers Tales  and for a while  they were kings of the IP crossover scene. But LEGO Marvel Super Heroes  which came at the tail-end of this heyday in 2013  is secretly the best one of all â\\x80\\x94 and now its on Switch  too. Theres a clear difference between games made with a lot of research  and games made with genuine love  and LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is the latter: there are so many references  in-jokes  and winks to the camera that its clear that this game is a labour of love made by superfans. But you dont need to be a superfan to enjoy the game â\\x80\\x94 and thank goodness for that  because trying to catch up on the Marvelverse these days is like attempting to memorise Wikipedia. That well-trodden Lego gameplay of smash everything until you figure out what to do next is still present in here; the difference is that now all of the characters have superpowers  and smashing things is infinitely more fun and varied. The characters are the shining Arc Reactor at the heart of Super Heroes  which is no surprise  given that Marvels roster has been built up over 60 years  in countless comics  movies  and even musical spin-offs. There are over 150 of the blighters to unlock  with multiple outfits for a few of them  like Iron Mans various suits  and Spider-Mans different costumes/identities. The more well-known characters will unlock throughout the story  but many more are also scattered throughout New York City  and youll have to complete puzzles to win them to your team. Every character has their own powers. Not all of them are unique  mind you â\\x80\\x94 many of them are some combination of flying/invisibility/shape shifting/lasers â\\x80\\x94 but the combinations are nonetheless extremely fun to play around with. Our favourite character was Dark Phoenix  because she can fly  set things on fire  use telekinesis  and control the minds of others; a close second was Squirrel Girl  who can summon armies of squirrels to tear people apart. Theyre all superheroes and villains  so its no surprise that theyre all extremely overpowered  but LEGO Marvel Super Heroes does a fantastic job of letting you feel powerful  not bored. The actual missions themselves limit you to a pre-chosen group  and although those characters will get you through the mission  they wont have all the necessary powers to unlock all the secrets within â\\x80\\x94 youll need to come back in Free Play for that  with a larger arsenal of superheroes to choose from. The plot can sometimes feel like a paint-by-numbers tutorial in which youre penalised for trying to skip ahead  though. Lego games want you to replay all the levels  so the missions are cluttered with stuff that you cant use yet. Youll get a lot of pop-ups about needing magnetic powers or web-slinging characters  and it can be frustrating if you know exactly what you need to do  but youre just not allowed. Whats more  the missions are visually cluttered as a result  and that means that it all looks a bit muddy on the Switch  especially in handheld mode. Because Super Heroes is at its best when youre able to freely switch between X-Men  Fantastic Four  and the Avengers  Free Play is undoubtedly the best part of the game. The missions usually take place in contained locations â\\x80\\x94 prisons  secret hideouts  Stark Tower  and so on â\\x80\\x94 but Free Play lets you roam around the entirety of New York City. The flying mechanic takes a while to get used to  but once youre au fait with Iron Mans blasters  you can zip around Manhattan in a flash. You can even float all the way up to the Helicarrier  stationed above the city  where all the collectibles are stored. In fact  flying is so much fun that it feels pretty disappointing when youre stuck as Hawkeye or Black Widow  whose superpowers are basically has a gun/bow/furrowed brow. New York City is also packed with collectibles  puzzles  side-quests  and mini-missions. There are Stan Lees to rescue  characters to unlock  and Gold Bricks â\\x80\\x94 the currency which lets you unlock special cheats and bonuses â\\x80\\x94 scattered around the place. Itll take you hours to reach 100% on this game  but those hours will be spent having a great time smashing up New York as Spider-Man. But these are all known quantities if youve ever played a Lego game  which all tend to pull from the same pool of ideas and mechanics that have proved successful in the past. Where LEGO Marvel Super Heroes sets itself apart is in the loving fanservice  and the game is packed with references to the wealth of lore that Marvel has. But its not like being cornered by an obnoxious nerd at a comic book store â\\x80\\x94 its more like a good pal cracking jokes while you watch the latest Avengers movie. Also  you get to punch stuff until money comes out. Whats not to love? Its a shame that the linear plot forces you to follow its restrictive rules in order to have no-strings freeplay fun  but the writing is enough to carry you along. Whether youre a Marvel ultra-fan or someone whos just seen a single Thor movie because you have a crush on Chris Hemsworth  LEGO Marvel Super Heroes will provide you with plenty of smashy  tongue-in-cheek joy. With split-screen co-op  and incredibly gentle expectations as far as the gameplay is concerned  LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is a fantastic  low-stakes game for parents and kids to play together  but also for adults who are looking for something that pleasantly whiles away the hours without beating you over the head with difficulty.
